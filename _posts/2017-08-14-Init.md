A bit tired but had fun time for a day.
Thanks for the all the helpful documents, I missed all of links though.

**What I have done for this first post:**
1. Just wanted to have my github page as well
* Forked ['Jekyll Now'](http://www.jekyllnow.com)
* Tried to find simple themes
  * [`Lagrange`](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/)
  * [`jekyll-simple`](http://wildflame.me/jekyll-simple/)
* Pushed to my github.io repository

2. Thought it would be better to have local server
* Removed 'Jekyll Now'
* Found [`Hexo`](https://hexo.io) to avoid installing the Ruby
* Installed 'Hexo' with npm
* Tried to find a simple theme
  * [`Bootstrap Blog`](http://cgmartin.github.io/hexo-theme-bootstrap-blog/)
* Deployed to github.io repository

3. Thought what if I'm not available to access my local for a new post?
* Removed Hexo
* Installed Ruby, finally
* Installed [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com) with gem
* Tried to find another simple theme
  * [`whiteglass`](https://yous.be/whiteglass)
* Added [`Disqus`](https://disqus.com/)
* Pushed to my github.io repository
